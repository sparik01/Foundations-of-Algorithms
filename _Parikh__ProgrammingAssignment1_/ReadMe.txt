Programming Assignment 1

-Netbeans was used for this programming project.

-Question 1:
	For the Brute Force Method: 
		Screenshots can be found in the output file for 
		10 points, 20 points, and 40 pairs
				
		A file of the results of the run for 40 points is
		also provided
						
		The actual points and number of points need to be 
		manually changed when running the program

	For the Divide and Conquer Method: 
		Screenshots can be found in the output file for 
		10 points, 20 points, 40 points and 100 points
		
		A file of the results of the run for 40 and 100 points is
		also provided

		The number of points need to be manually changed when running the program 
		where noted

-Question 2: 
	Turing Machine
		Screenshots can be found in output file
		Actual results file can be found for large inputs
		
		The input of the binary number needs to be in the format specified in the 
		program for subtraction, addition, and multiplication

		b.Addition (works on the type of binary numbers and the format listed 
		below)
         	
			format1: 1010@1010&$ (alternating numbers added to each other with 
			@ as the + and ending with &$)  
        	
			format2: 111111111111@111111111111&$ 
                	(series of 1's added to each other of same size with @ as the +     
			and ending with &$)                                             
       
       		c. subtraction (works on the type of binary numbers and the format 
		listed below)
            	      	format:  input form A-B = AcB ; answer is before the c 
                      	examples: 01c011, 011111c000100, etc.
       
      	        d. multiplication (works on the type of binary numbers and format listed 		below)
            		format: 10000***_10000$ or 11*_10$
