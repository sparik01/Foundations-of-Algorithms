Programming Assignment 1

-Netbeans was used for this programming project.

3 Projects
	1.) Median3Sort - my implementation (replacing median as pivot 
			 starting at first element of array)
		
		-generates number of swaps and comparisons
			-but did swaps did not work for sorted array

		- Output file: Quicksort Median Output

	2.) QuickSortBookMedian3 - using book quicksort for median 3 (replacing median as 
			pivot starting at last element of array)
		
		-generates number of swaps and comparisons
		-Output file: QuicksortBookMedian Output

	3.) QuickSortBook - book implementation of regular quicksort
		-generates number of swaps and comparisons
		-Output file: QuicksortBook Output	

*For all projects random integers generated
	-need to turn off or on lines of code for testing manually 				entered sorted array of size n=50 and n=100
	-all projects generated the number of swaps and comparisons
			- the QuickSort 
	
**the source code alone saved in “All Source Code” file
