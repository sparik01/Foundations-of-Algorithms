Programming Assignment 3

-Netbeans was used for this programming project.

- The project uses 4 example inputs for strings x, y, and s

	- for example this is what is shown in the source code for each string input :
		      String y = "00";                 //example 1
           	     // String y = "00000";            //example 2
                     // String y ="00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";   
                                                              //example 3
                     // String y = "00000000000000000000";     //example 4

	- the code has to be adjusted depending on what example needs to be run
	- the minimum length of s must be x.length + y.length

*the source code alone saved in “All Source Code” folder
**Screenshots and output files saved in Output/Screenshot folder
